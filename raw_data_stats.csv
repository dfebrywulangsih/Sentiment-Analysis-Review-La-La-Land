5.0,"I want to take some time to talk about the Epilogue of the film. I've heard many different theories about what the Epilogue truly means. The reality is the idea that true love is being willing to make sacrifices. In this Epilogue, Sebastian was far more willing to make sacrifices for Mia than she was for him. There is a scene earlier on in the film that beautifully foreshadows the entire story. The scene after Sebastian finds Mia's keys and…",445,80

4.5,"Jacques Demy for the digital age... walks the uneasy bridge between romance and reality almost as nimbly as Singin' in the Rain did the one between silent films and talkies. i think this is a more difficult — and more rewarding — film than some people are expecting, or will be interested in seeing. the way it disintegrates from the technicolor to the quotidian, from a romance about movies to a movie about romance... it's a bold move, executed to…",450,80

Bad news for those same people: I still think the opening is so beautiful and celebratory and exuberant in a way I want more movies to be, I still think Emma Stone is so fucking fantastic and deserved the Best Actress Oscar, and Damien Chazelle deserved his Best Director Oscar!

4.5,"Rewatched this because Dunkey told me to and surprise surprise it's still magnificent. I'm not super into Ryan Gosling's performance but the gorgeous cinematography, breathtaking musical numbers, electric romantic chemistry, and sublime writing perfectly illustrate why Damien Chazelle is an absolute master of his craft. Not quite as perfect as Whiplash, but it does have the slightly better ending. Hell, maybe the best ending I've ever seen in a movie.",455,70

3.0,"Occasionally a nice tonic, and pretty, but mostly a timid musical mixed with a bland romance. How the guy who made WHIPLASH failed...no, scratch that, barely even tried to make this take off until the last 20 minutes or so is baffling. Why does this plateau as soon as they get together? Why is so much of this (like say their one argument or the stories of their respective hopes) not in song? Where did all of Chazelle's energy go?",433,80
5.0,"this single handedly reinvented musicals, singing, dancing, cinematography, comedy, seasons of the year, the piano, every color on the entire color spectrum, romance, jazz and pure joy also: 1. in the middle of the ending the projector messed up and so they played it back and i got to cry over that spectacular ending twice in a row, and 2. i met damien chazelle!",364,64

Quite literally a film that leaves me speechless, never failing to mesmerize me in its romantic story-telling and heartbreaking, yet awe-inspiring, character work and portrait of love.

An ode to old Hollywood filmmaking with its vibrant use of color and Pulp Fiction-esque production design. Chazelle feels as passionate as I’ve ever seen…",504,80

3.0,Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the reasons in my humble opinion the masses have gone Ga Ga for La La Land. The It Guy. The It Girl. A romance for the ages. The couple we all love.

5.0,TIFF 2016 Film #17 Cinema has officially been reborn. La La Land is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. This movie gives me life. It's absolutely electrifying.

3.5,"70 Gosh, it sucks that this movie is merely very good, because at its best, La La Land is one of the greatest films about the Hollywood Dream Factory. The dance against the LA skyline, the sunset merging with twilight, colors glowing against the extravagant costuming. Just lovely. Too often it falls into the rut of not embracing the 'musical' element. A film as gorgeous as this should be bouncing off the walls as a full-fledged musical. But the worst…",455,80
5.0,"As the year closes, Chazelle provides the perfect antidote to the ruthless bastard that is 2016. There's a conversation in this film where the superb (easily her career best performance) Emma Stone expresses her fears that the play she wrote could be seen as too old-fashioned by people, to which the fantastic (and jealousy inducing bastard) Ryan Gosling responds with a heartfelt 'Fuck other people!'. This is Chazelle not caring and indulging in what is essentially two hours of movie…",488,80

2.0,"I kinda want to punch people comparing this to Demy in the face as much as I wanted to punch Gosling’s (whose self-absorption is put to great use here even if I’m not sure it was intentional). That said, the anxiety of failure that runs as undercurrent throughout this does stings some. It is half a prick’s wish-fulfillment fantasy and half a manic depressed nightmare of someone afraid to be exposed and the way those disparate parts run together is curious at least.",469,83

It is such a special place to come back to whenever I want to be fully immersed by cinema and art, the true meaning of both those things and the power they can hold.

Sometimes…",407,81
1.5,"The most artless celebration of art I have ever witnessed. Art is basically what a very few people (this film's intended audience of The Academy) get to do for a living in this film.

4.5,"Part of me acknowledges the irony of creating a film about “daring to dream” within Hollywood, the most restrictive, exclusive, unwelcoming system of any artistic medium. I also acknowledge the irony of not taking a risk on two unknowns and instead casting two of the biggest stars in the world, and how much that diminishes the impact of those desired themes. The other part of me knows this is still magical and that the first part of me thinks too much.",456,81
5.0,"“ La La Land ”, directed by Damien Chazelle, is an absolute triumph that transports the audience to a world of dazzling dreams and sincere emotions.

She is a fine actress, particularly adept with comedy, but as Mia she is a mediocre singer and a subpar dancer.

One could almost understand this if Chazelle's purpose were a sort of pro-am Everyman musical along the lines of Everyone…",463,80
5.0,"This film is the true definition of a masterpiece. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling acting together is pure magic. I'll never forget the first time I watched this in cinema back in 2016. I had just gone through an experience of what I thought was ""right person, wrong time"". So, the ending hit me like a ton of bricks back then and immediately brought tears to my eyes.

3.5,"70 La La Land succeeds, no, scratch that, *soars* when it's in song. Damien Chazelle's newest film about the allure of music and the relationships which stumble within it is nothing less than a marvelous concoction of sunshine and warm, fuzzy twilight condensed into light taps, swooning dance motions, and large musical gestures. There's an old-school magic to seeing two movie stars float among the stars, a dream played out through a projector, frazzled and exultant, and each step feels…",491,80

5.0,La La Land is my favourite film of all time. If I were to enjoy a new film in the future it wouldn’t come close to my love for La La Land.

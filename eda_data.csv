"I want to take some time to talk about the Epilogue of the film. I've heard many different theories about what the Epilogue truly means. The reality is the idea that true love is being willing to make sacrifices. In this Epilogue, Sebastian was far more willing to make sacrifices for Mia than she was for him. There is a scene earlier on in the film that beautifully foreshadows the entire story. The scene after Sebastian finds Mia's keys and…",positive,positive,positive

"Jacques Demy for the digital age... walks the uneasy bridge between romance and reality almost as nimbly as Singin' in the Rain did the one between silent films and talkies. i think this is a more difficult — and more rewarding — film than some people are expecting, or will be interested in seeing. the way it disintegrates from the technicolor to the quotidian, from a romance about movies to a movie about romance... it's a bold move, executed to…",positive,positive,positive

"Rewatched this because Dunkey told me to and surprise surprise it's still magnificent. I'm not super into Ryan Gosling's performance but the gorgeous cinematography, breathtaking musical numbers, electric romantic chemistry, and sublime writing perfectly illustrate why Damien Chazelle is an absolute master of his craft. Not quite as perfect as Whiplash, but it does have the slightly better ending. Hell, maybe the best ending I've ever seen in a movie.",positive,positive,positive

"Occasionally a nice tonic, and pretty, but mostly a timid musical mixed with a bland romance. How the guy who made WHIPLASH failed...no, scratch that, barely even tried to make this take off until the last 20 minutes or so is baffling. Why does this plateau as soon as they get together? Why is so much of this (like say their one argument or the stories of their respective hopes) not in song? Where did all of Chazelle's energy go?",positive,negative,negative

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the reasons in my humble opinion the masses have gone Ga Ga for La La Land. The It Guy. The It Girl. A romance for the ages. The couple we all love.

TIFF 2016 Film #17 Cinema has officially been reborn. La La Land is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. This movie gives me life. It's absolutely electrifying.

"70 Gosh, it sucks that this movie is merely very good, because at its best, La La Land is one of the greatest films about the Hollywood Dream Factory. The dance against the LA skyline, the sunset merging with twilight, colors glowing against the extravagant costuming. Just lovely. Too often it falls into the rut of not embracing the 'musical' element. A film as gorgeous as this should be bouncing off the walls as a full-fledged musical. But the worst…",positive,negative,negative
"As the year closes, Chazelle provides the perfect antidote to the ruthless bastard that is 2016. There's a conversation in this film where the superb (easily her career best performance) Emma Stone expresses her fears that the play she wrote could be seen as too old-fashioned by people, to which the fantastic (and jealousy inducing bastard) Ryan Gosling responds with a heartfelt 'Fuck other people!'. This is Chazelle not caring and indulging in what is essentially two hours of movie…",positive,positive,positive

"I kinda want to punch people comparing this to Demy in the face as much as I wanted to punch Gosling’s (whose self-absorption is put to great use here even if I’m not sure it was intentional).

"Part of me acknowledges the irony of creating a film about “daring to dream” within Hollywood, the most restrictive, exclusive, unwelcoming system of any artistic medium.

"[5] Neither outstanding nor horrid. It seems rather puzzling, though, that so much of the project rests on Emma Stone's shoulders. She is a fine actress, particularly adept with comedy, but as Mia she is a mediocre singer and a subpar dancer.

Damien Chazelle's newest film about the allure of music and the relationships which stumble within it is nothing less than a marvelous concoction of sunshine and warm, fuzzy twilight condensed into light taps, swooning dance motions, and large musical gestures.

La La Land is my favourite film of all time. If I were to enjoy a new film in the future it wouldn’t come close to my love for La La Land.

"Instantly enchanting and impossibly charming, Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" is both a throwback and a glance forward. An original musical comedy that buzzes with a golden age energy at the same times it bristles with contemporary verve, Chazelle's film sings and swings its way off the screen, launching itself with undeniable joy into the hearts and minds of its audience. It is an experience the pulses and beats with pure, cinematic bliss. ""La La Land"" is the story of…",positive,positive,positive

"“I guess I’ll see you in the movies” I’ll start off by saying that I usually don’t enjoy musicals however… when it comes to La La Land there’s an exception. La La Land is absolutely flawless in every aspect possible. Damien Chazelle is an incredible director. The cinematography is god damn stunning, and the acting is amazing. As I mentioned in a previous review, we all know how good the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is, and it fucking flourishes in this film. Won’t lie, the ending always gets the emotions going. Absolute Cinema. 💯 🎵 🎹 🎬 Ryan Gosling Ranked Favorite Films",positive,positive,positive

"A celebration of colors contrasted by breathtaking monochromatic backdrops, damien chazelle reminds the increasingly minimalistic world of motion pictures what movies are essentially about -- motion , then invites us to tap our feet, spin around like we're in a silent movie and dance along to the gradual build-up of trombones, via fluid, energetic camerawork and precise choreography. I can not give this any less than a perfect rating, I am a slave to this film and its music.",positive,positive,positive
Ever since I saw this at TIFF back in September I've been DYING to see it again. La La Land is a triumph. I love this movie so much. A spell-binding film that took my breath away once again. Emma Stone was sensational. Ryan Gosling was fantastic. Them together is magical. The ending ruined me again. It's arguably even better the second time around.
